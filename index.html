        <p class="lead mb-4">Hello, my name is Angela Rincon and I am a psychology major at the University of California, Riverside. <br><br>

        I am a first year at UCR. Before college however, I attended Northview High School in Covina, California. I graduated from Northview High School with honors. I was involved on campus; such as Key Club and AVID Club, in the AVID curriculum all throughout high school, and maintained high grades and honor roll as well.  I was in AVID since 7th grade and I learned how to be organized in and outside of a school environment, how to succeed in college, and especially being a first generation student, it taught me how to apply, deadlines, exams, and everything you needed to apply and prepare for college. I was also involved in my community, volunteering with several organizations and at several events. I was able to volunteer at the Rose Parade float set ups, Coreyâ€™s Kitchen, and the Covina Christmas Parade through Key Club. Because of my service from being in the club, I learned how much I enjoyed volunteering. I was able to volunteer for Kaiserâ€™s Educational Outreach Office in Baldwin Park where I did 6 hours a week as an after-school helper for kids and math tutor for kids as well. I had so much exposure to kids during this time and again I realized that not only do I enjoy helping others, but more so children and from here I was able to develop what I wanted to do for my career in the future. I decided to major in psychology when I began applying to colleges and I started a plan for myself: To get my undergraduate in Psychology, attend graduate school for Developmental or Clinical Psychology, and finally become a Psychologist. Once accepted into UCR, I immediately felt that it was the university for me. I loved the diversity, the distance from home, the psychology program, and the overall environment of the campus. I fully believed and still believe that UCR is the best school to fulfill my dreams of becoming a psychologist and this was further proved to me after my first quarter here. I took Psych 001 my first quarter, my first psychology course ever, and I fell even more in love with the subject than I ever thought I could. My professor was the best professor Iâ€™ve had here yet and the topics discussed were things I never knew I would enjoy so much in psychology. For example, I have never been a biology or anatomy fan, but in this class when we went over the biological and neuroscience section, I thrived and felt it was the best section throughout the whole course. I got a nearly perfect score on my midterm, which was again shocking since I had never liked these subjects. Being here has already in just one quarter taught me more and about myself and my interests and has expanded my viewpoint drastically. I am fully committed to university and I plan to continue to try my hardest and find my place in psychology more and more with each course I take.<br><br>

        I am excited for my future in psychology, hopefully working in a lab and getting internships as soon as I can.
